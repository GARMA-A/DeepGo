# Go philosophy
#### Go has a strong enough type system to avoid most careless mistakes found in dynamic languages.
#### Its type system is simpler compared to other statically typed languages.
#### Go can lead to some "untyped" pockets within its type-safe framework.
#### Go programmers do not use types for safety proofs like in C++ or Haskell.
#### Despite a simpler type system, Go provides safety and performance benefits without much complexity.
#### Go emphasizes modern system design, focusing on data locality.
#### Its data types and libraries work naturally without needing explicit initialization or constructors.
#### Go avoids hidden memory allocations and writes in code.

## Hello World
```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}

```

#### Go code is organized into packages,
#### which are similar to libraries or modules in other
#### languages. A package consists of one or more .go source files
#### in a single directory that
#### define what the package does. Each source file begins with a
#### package declaration, here `package main`, that states which package the file belongs to,
#### followed by a list of other packages that it imports, and then the declarations
#### of the program that are stored in that file.
<hr/>

# package `main`

#### Package `main` is special. It defines a standalone executable
#### program, not a library. Within `package main`, the
#### function `main` is
#### also special—it’s where execution of the program begins. Whatever `main`
#### does is what the program does. Of course, `main` will normally call upon
#### functions in other packages to do much of the work, such as
#### the function `fmt.Println`.

# import()

#### The import declarations must follow the package declaration. 
#### After that,a program consists of the declarations of functions, variables,
#### constants, and types
#### (introduced by the keywords func, var, const, and type);
